# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
Each of them aims to be reasonably efficient, idiomatic, and readable. Each is
also thoroughly commented (in terms of what the Rust features are doing, and
also in terms of overall strategy/problem logic). All solutions are written as
Rust tests, so they can be run and verified via `cargo test`.

*Warning: Spoilers! Each implementation includes the answer along with the code,
so that it can be tested!*
